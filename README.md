# Calculator
Hello! This is my calculator that I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It offers basic functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. To use the calculator, simply click the numbers and operators, then press the equals button. You can also press the delete key on your keyboard to remove inputs one at a time.
